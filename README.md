# DriverDrowsinessDetectionApp
This Application built with Tkinter GUI detects with a camera if a driver is drowsy or sleeping. If so, the app start an alarm to alert the driver

## Note 
The face detection uses the "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks" file. It is not uploaded in this repository due to its big size (97Mb). So for the python code (or the jupyter notebook) to work, the file need to be uploaded in the same folder as the python or jupyter notebook files. The .dat file is everywhere on the internet, you can download it using this link : https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
